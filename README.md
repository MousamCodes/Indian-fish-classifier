# Indian-ish Image Classifier

This project is an image classification model built to distinguish and categorize images based on Indian-themed categories. The classifier uses deep learning techniques and has been trained with various images to achieve high accuracy in identifying specific features in Indian cultural, scenic, and other relevant imagery.

## Project Overview

The **Indian-ish Image Classifier** leverages computer vision and machine learning to identify and classify images into categories related to Indian culture. The project uses libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras to preprocess the images, train the model, and predict classes for new images.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: The pipeline includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation using OpenCV and Keras' ImageDataGenerator.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built with TensorFlow and Keras, featuring CNN layers to effectively capture spatial information.
- **Categorization**: Categorizes images into distinct Indian cultural themes or scenes.
